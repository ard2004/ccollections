# Architecture
we are following modular architecture.    
Each data structure will have its own header file for declarations and a corresponding source file for implementations     
For each data structure, you:     

    1. Define a header file (.h): This file includes the type definitions, function declarations, and any necessary constants or macros.
    2. Define a source file (.c): This file contains the function implementations declared in the header file.
